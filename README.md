Don't be fooled by imitations (I'm looking at you P-Hound), Fakeblock by George Maharis is THE genuine wood block simulator you've heard so much about. 
Have you ever been in line at the grocery store or bank and wished you could pound out a few sweet knocks on a block of canary wood? Tired of carrying a man-purse just so you can have a full set of mallets for your impromptu tap sessions? Fakeblock by George Maharis gives you wood in your pocket, without the sharp corners.

"I developed Fakeblock after being disappointed by other block simulators. Where are the wood grain options?, I asked. What about different mallets and weights. Fakeblock lets you choose from a variety of grains, from the soothing familiar rap of birdseye maple to the sultry exotic knock of masscar ebony. And have you ever hit a block of oak with a frozen banana? Don't knock it until you try it (see what I did there, "knock it"?). 
--George Maharis, Frozen banana salesman and wood block prodigy
